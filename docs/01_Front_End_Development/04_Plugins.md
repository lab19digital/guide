We use Bootstrap 3/Less currently as our CSS framework, with plans to move to Bootstrap 4/Sass when it's ready for production.

For JavaScript, we commonly use the following plugins when required. Most of these require jQuery as a dependency.

1. [Slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) for sliders
2. [Typeahead.js](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/) for autocomplete (with Bloodhound)
3. [Fancybox](https://github.com/fancyapps/fancyBox) for modals, unless Bootstrap suffices
4. [Accordion](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse) for collapsible divs
5. [Scrollspy](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy) for fixing nav content as you scroll
