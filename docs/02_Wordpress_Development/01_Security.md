This point is first in the list because it's one of the things people often leave last on a project or completely forget about. Security is absolutely critical on a Wordpress site because Wordpress is regularly targeted by hackers for the purposes of installing malware on websites. Once malware has been injected into a site it's very difficult to get rid, so it pays to take a few steps to ensure the site is secure. 

1. Read through and implement the tips found in [Hardening Wordpress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress)
2. Only use plugins that are popular and regularly updated, and keep your plugins up to date
3. Make sure you sanitise any input processed by your vanilla PHP
4. Install the Wordfence plugin to track security issues with the site
5. Shared environments also lead to hacks. Host on a service like WPengine for maximum security
6. Where possible, implement daily backups so that the site can be restored to a previous snapshot at will
