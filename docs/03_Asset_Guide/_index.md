If you're a designer and you have to hand over PSDs to us, please be vigilant about the format of your files. It can be very time consuming to export assets from a PSD if it's poorly formatted. Have a look at [http://photoshopetiquette.com/](http://photoshopetiquette.com/) for precise information on how to prepare a PSD for the web.

Most importantly, you need to use a 12 column grid. You also *must* understand how a grid works. 

Here is a summary of important points in a PSD from Photoshop Etiquette:

1. Consolidate your PSDs. Keep your designs to a minimal number of PSDs. 
2. Name files appropriately. Have a pattern for filenames so we know exactly which file is the latest.
3. Make your files easily available to teammates (use Dropbox and Google Drive).
4. Choose a convention and stick with it. Pick an order. Use hyphens or underscores but not both. Never spaces. 
5. Don't design to the device. Device sizes change regularly as new devices come out (for example, iPhone 6 Plus)

6. Name layers and be accurate about describing them
7. Use groups
8. **Delete unnecessary layers**
9. Globalize common elements like logos
10. Collapse upon exit

11. Be nondestructive
12. Use blend modes with care
13. Be aware of screen resolution and density. 
14. When exporting to web, use Save for Web.
15. No unnecessary space when exporting assets. Web will be responsible for spacing.
16. Work collaboratively. 

17. Centralize fonts. Make every attempt to draw from the same font pool as your team.
18. Don't stretch type.
19. Control your text boxes. Don't make them larger than they need be.
20. Separate your text boxes.
21. Use character styles for consistency.
